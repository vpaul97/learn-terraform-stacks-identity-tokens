# Learn Terraform Stacks: Identity Tokens

This repository contains Terraform configurations that demonstrate how to
configure Cloud providers for use with Terraform Stacks.

Within Stacks, users can define `identity_token` blocks. These blocks generate a
[JWT](https://jwt.io/) that can then be exchanged with cloud providers via OAuth
/ OIDC.

In order for these tokens to be valid, you must first configure your target
cloud provider so that it trusts JWTs generated by HCP Terraform. This
repository contains example Terraform configurations for configuring trust and
permissions between HCP, AWS, and GCP accounts and Terraform Stacks.
